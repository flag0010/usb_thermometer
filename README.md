hacking a cheap usb thermometer to send notifications about house temp

When I leave my home empty in the winter I always worry my furnace will die, causing my house to freeze (broken pipes/water damage). Commercial wifi based temperature notification systems are available (e.g. Nest), but all I've seen cost >$150.  I wondered if I could use a cheap USB thermometer ($13 on Amazon) attached to an old mac laptop and have it send notifications via email.  Read the `setup.md` file to get a handle on the steps involved.
